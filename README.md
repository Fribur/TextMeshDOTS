# TextMeshDOTS

TextMeshDOTS is a fork of [Latios Framework/Calligraphics](https://github.com/Dreaming381/Latios-Framework/tree/master/Calligraphics). It aims to provide DOTS native 
world space text similar to TextMeshPro and TextCore GameObject based text. To keep
cross dependencies to a minimum, we aim to only depend on unmodified [Unity Entities](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@1.2/manual/index.html),
[Unity Entities Graphics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities.graphics@1.2/manual/index.html) and some functionality in the `UnityEngine.TextCore` namespace to 
be able to utilize TextCore FontAssets.

# How to use
-	generate backend mesh: `Menue-->TextMeshDOTS-->Text Backend mesh`
-   create a subscene
-   add empty gameobject
-   add TextRenderer component
-   set font asset to `TextMeshDOTS/Fonts/LiberationSans SDF`, type in some text
-   close subscene
-	font entity will be backed to an entity containing a number of components, amongst them  `DynamicBuffer<RenderGlyph>`. This buffer contains all data required for rendering the text


# Known issues
-   Unity 6000.0.b15 apears to have a bug extracting the GlyphAdjustment table, which contains many non-sensical adjustment pairs between glyphs that are not found in the character table. 
That leads to a TextRenderer backing error. So when you re-generate the FontAsset, ensure you do not extract font features (GlyphAdjustment table needs to have 0 entries).
-   the entire render functionality (systems that consume `DynamicBuffer<RenderGlyph>`, and render it) is missing right now
