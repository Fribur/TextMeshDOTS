# TextMeshDOTS

TextMeshDOTS is a fork [Latios Framework/Calligraphics](https://github.com/Dreaming381/Latios-Framework/tree/master/Calligraphics) Its aims to provide DOTS native 
world space text similar to TextMeshPro and TextCore GameObject based text. To keep
cross dependencies to a minimum, we aim to only depend on the unmodified [Unity Entities](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@1.2/manual/index.html),
[Unity Entities Graphics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities.graphics@1.2/manual/index.html) and some functionality in the UnityEngine.TextCore namespace to 
be able to utilize TextCore FontAssets.
